    Hello! My name is Solaina, and I am an 8th grader at EPS. I made this website to tell you a little bit about myself. This website has an About Me page, a photo gallery, a details page, a classes page, and a contact page, where you can find my interests and hobbies, my contact information, and some facts about my classes. In my free time, I enjoy travelling, reading, and participating in other activities that can be found on my interests page. I am an only child, but have had a few pets in the past, and I enjoy visiting my grandma, who lives in Canada. I have a large friend group, and the majority of us participate in extracurriculars and activities together. Outside and inside of school, I attend piano classes, go to RSM classes, and participate in different school clubs and sports, such as 8th grade leadership lab. In the coming months, I am looking forward to my EBC trip, meeting new people, and attending several summer camps that I am excited about, such as Harvard Debate Camp! For EBC, I am going to the Florida Keys to learn about marine science. I am excited to snorkel and kayak and learn more about marine life in that area. Currently, I am working on my final assignments for Literary Thinking 3, WEB, Spanish 2 and Scientific Thinking 3. Thank you, and I hope you enjoy my website!
