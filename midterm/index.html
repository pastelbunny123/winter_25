    <p>The goal of this website is to explore and learn about the season of Winter. In these pages, I will go over the traditions, activities, and celebrations related to the season of Winter. The details page of this website will give an overview of Winter and the history of some of its celebrations, along with providing links to outer pages that provide more detailed information. The photos section of this website is a photo gallery of popular winter sports and activities, including skiing, winter festivals, and dog sledding. Each photo has an attached description and caption to allow the reader to have a deeper understanding of each topic and image. I hope you enjoy! </p>
